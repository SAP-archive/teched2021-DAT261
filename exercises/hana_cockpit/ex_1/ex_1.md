# Exercise 1: The Database Overview Page

The Database Overview page displays health metrics for an individual SAP HANA Cloud database.

Through the Database Overview page, you can view key health indicators for this specific database, such as database status, alerts, and resource utilization. You also have access to tools that allow you to perform database administrations tasks, such as performance analysis, and executing SQL statements. Different parts of a single card can link to different views or applications. This way, you can see various components in a single view and make the decision whether to further examine issues by drilling down.

This exercise will teach you the basics of navigating the Database Overview page and how to find the information you need as a database administrator.
