# Exercise 1: The Database Overview Page

The Database Overview page displays health metrics for an individual SAP HANA Cloud database.

Through the Database Overview page, you can view key health indicators for this specific database, such as database status, alerts, and resource utilization. You also have access to tools that allow you to perform database administrations tasks, such as performance analysis, and executing SQL statements. Different parts of a single card can link to different views or applications. This way, you can see various components in a single view and make the decision whether to further examine issues by drilling down.

This exercise will teach you the basics of navigating the Database Overview page and how to find the information you need as a database administrator.

1. Navigate to your SAP HANA Cloud Trial instance from the SAP BTP Cockpit ("trial" subaccount and "dev" space). Open the SAP HANA cockpit by clicking item **Open in SPA HANA Cockpit** from the **Actions** menu.

    **Note:** *If this is the first time you launch the SAP HANA cockpit or SAP HANA Database Explorer, you will be asked to enter your credentials. The default username is DBADMIN and the password is what you entered when creating the instance.*
