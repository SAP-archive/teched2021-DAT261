# Exercise 1 - Apply Filters

In this exercise, we will filter the instances based on their properties. If you are already aware of the Instance ID or Name of the instance, then you can put it in here and you will see only the respective instance in the list. If you wish to see all the instances under your Organization and Space, you can just click on the highlighted button and then you can see all your instances listed.


1. Click on the Instance ID or Name field.

4. Instances can also be filtered based on the Status of the instance. On clicking the dropdown button, we can see list of various statuses from which the user can choose one or many statuses based on which he needs his search results. The various instance statuses are: Running, Starting, Creating, Stopping, Stopped, Error, Other.
For example - If the user wants to see list of instances that are still being created, he can choose the check box corresponding to 'Creating'.

On clicking the dropdown button, we can see list of various alerts from which the user can choose one or many alerts based on which he needs his search results. The alerts on which filtering can be performed are: None, Information, Warning, Error, and Critical.
For example - If the user wants to see list of instances with the alert 'Error', he can choose the checkbox corresponding to the Error option in the dropdown.
