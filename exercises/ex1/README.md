# Exercise 1 - Apply Filters

In this exercise, we will filter the instances based on their properties. If you are already aware of the Instance ID or Name of the instance, then you can put it in here and you will see only the respective instance in the list. If you wish to see all the instances under your Organization and Space, you can just click on the highlighted button and then you can see all your instances listed.
